1. Run Program
2. Place Your Ships
   a. You have 5 ships to place, a carrier, a battleship, a cruiser, a submarine, and a destroyer
   b. Place your ship on the grid, (A1 - H8)
   c. Choose the angle you place your ship at (0-3)
3. Shoot at your opponent's ships (A1-H8)
4. Sink all your opponent's ships. Or don't. I don't care.

COM Only Version
----------------
> "B7" -COM2

I adjusted the program to create a version of the game where two COM players play against eachother. This version is on the COM-Only branch. Just compile and run the program, and watch the both of them play.
